/**
 * Helper class for dealing with eventual consistency of S3 store.
 *
 * S3 store has a concept of eventual consistency: for example, when an object is requested after it has been overwritten,
 * it may still return the old version of the object, but eventually it will return the updated version.
 *
 * The tests in {@link AbstractN5Test} write and then immediately read attributes and data blocks to verify them.
 * Eventual consistency makes some of these tests fail. To solve or at least minimize this effect,
 * this class adds a 1s delay after each modification request.
 *
 * @see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/Introduction.html#ConsistencyModel">https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/Introduction.html#ConsistencyModel</a>
